						<h4> Hey! You wanna come in? </h4>
						<p> Stray Kids is a South Korean boy group that debuted under JYP Entertainment! They were formed under a survival show of the same name in 2017 and debuted officially on March 25, 2018. The group started out with 9 members but now, they only have 8 members. </p>
						<p> The group has garnered more attention from both local and international fans after the release of their song, God's Menu.</p>
						<h5> In the rightmost picture, from left to right, top to bottom. Changbin, Felix, I.N., Lee Know, Han, Seungmin, Hyunjin, and Bang Chan. </h5>

					<div id="Paragraph2">
						<p> Stray Kids call their fandom "STAY". It comes from "Stray" and they removed the letter R because STAY are the reason why Stray Kids exists. It is also an adorable homage to the group's tagline "You Make Stray Kids STAY". We love a group that loves their fans as much as their fans love them! </p>
